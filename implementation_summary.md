## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation

### New Model Fields
Added to `ImperiumCharacter.swift`:
```swift
// Character information
var shortTermGoal: String = ""
var longTermGoal: String = ""
var characterDescription: String = ""

// Status tracking
var criticalWounds: Int = 0

// Experience tracking
var totalExperience: Int = 0
var spentExperience: Int = 0
var availableExperience: Int { totalExperience - spentExperience }

// Injury lists (JSON stored)
var headInjuries: String = ""
var armInjuries: String = ""
var bodyInjuries: String = ""
var legInjuries: String = ""

// Conditions (JSON stored)
var conditionsData: String = ""
```

### New Calculation Methods
```swift
func calculateMaxWounds() -> Int {
    let strengthComponent = (strength - strength % 10) / 10
    let willpowerComponent = (willpower - willpower % 10) / 10
    let toughnessComponent = 2 * ((toughness - toughness % 10) / 10)
    return strengthComponent + willpowerComponent + toughnessComponent
}

func calculateCorruptionThreshold() -> Int {
    let willpowerComponent = (willpower - willpower % 10) / 10
    let toughnessComponent = (toughness - toughness % 10) / 10
    return willpowerComponent + toughnessComponent
}
```

### New UI Components
- `StatusPopupView`: Comprehensive status management with +/- controls
- `InjuriesPopupView`: Tabbed interface for managing critical wounds
- `InjuryListView`: Individual injury category management
- `AddInjurySheet`: Selection interface for adding new injuries
