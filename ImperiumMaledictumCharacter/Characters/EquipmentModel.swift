You may never spend Fate to modify the results of this Test. If you succeed by +2 SL or more, you glimpse vague portents of a promising future, and immediately recover 1 Fate point. If you fail by âˆ’2 SL or more, you glimpse dark paths before you, and immediately lose 1 Fate point. If you Fumble, you must instead burn one Fate point â€” the Emperor's Tarot is not to be trifled with, and some futures were never meant to be known.\nYou can only read the Emperor's Tarot once per session. If you wish, you can read the Tarot of another willing character, in which case you make the Discipline Test, but apply any modifications to Fate to the character who's Tarot you read. Reading the Emperor's Tarot for a Character who has burned all of their Fate has no effect â€” whatever their destiny, it is sealed and well beyond the reach of any mortal soothsayer.",
